The classic board game Peg Solitaire implemented in Java

There are three board types in which the game can be played: English "plus shaped" Board, European "circular shaped" Board, and Triangular "triangle shaped" Board. The game is won when there is only one marble remaining. The game is over when the user quits, or there are no moves remaining.

For Triangular gameplay, the gameboard must be an integer greater than 2. Moves can me horizontal or diagonal.
