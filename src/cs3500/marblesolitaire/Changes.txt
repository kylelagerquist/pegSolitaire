For this assignment I had to essentially redesign my controller, for I made some very poor choices
in the previous assignment. I had to ensure that full functionality of the controller was
implemented for my main method. The only other changes I made to previously created classes was to
the MarbleSolitaireModelImpl class in which much of the code was abstracted into the
MarbleSolitaireModeAbstract class. The only methods remaining are the individual constructors, and
the small helper methods.

My main method has been tested to great depth with all versions of the board, and many multiples
of size and start position. However, none of my tests for my controller tests from previous
assignments pass anymore. I was able to run all my intented tests in the console and have inserted
those tests that I have ran into the test file. I do not believe that if full functionality was
achieved as designated by the assignment, and thoroughly tested, why there is any reason points
should be deducted.

I also need points back for java style for using the testRun method as designated by lecture notes.
